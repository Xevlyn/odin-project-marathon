<!--
        the lang attribute specifies the language of the text in the element and is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage
    
        Head - 
        <head> is the element we place important met information about our webpages and information required to make our webpages render correctly in the browser. Elements that display in the browser shouldn't be place here.

        Charset meta element -
        <meta charset="utf-8"> for setting the encoding for the webpage since this ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.

        Title - 
        <title></title> used to give webpages a human-readable title which is displayed in our webpages browser tab. If this is not included, it will default to the name of the webpage index.html if the case be.

        Body - 
        <body></body> where all the content of the web page will be placed in  and this is the final element needed to complete the HTML boiler plate. THis goes beneath the head tag.

        More later on but these are the more important ones for now.
